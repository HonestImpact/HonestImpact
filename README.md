**AI Engineer | Executive Coach | Builder of Production Multi-Agent Systems**

I returned to programming after more than fifteen years to discover something remarkable: the gap gave me clarity. While I was leading teams and managing $2–$7M+ budgets, the industry moved from Ingres, Solaris, and legacy Oracle databases to vector embeddings. But the fundamentals—systems thinking, user needs, planning ahead, paying attention, developing in slices, shipping under pressure—those transfer perfectly.

**Today**: Two agentic systems in production, paying clients, and unusual perspective on what it takes to ship AI that matters.

## What I Build 

### [TryIt-AI (Noah)](https://github.com/HonestImpact/TryItAIagentic/tree/feat/agentic-refactor) — Trust-First AI for Skeptics
**Status**: Production | Scale-to-Zero on Koyeb

The only AI assistant designed for people who see through the hype.

**Why it matters**:
- Multi-agent orchestration with metacognitive self-evaluation
- Beauty checks before shipping: "Would I show this to a senior engineer?"
- Transparent decision-making: Shows reasoning, not just results
- Dual Search Strategy in a single PostgreSQL Supabase database: different tables (tool_library vs tool_embeddings) and different search methods (FTS vs vector similarity)

**The design philosophy**: Noah doesn't want your blind trust. Built for genuine skeptics with standards—personality in every code comment, craftsperson pride in every output.

**Stack**: Next.js 15, LangGraph, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Supabase, TypeScript

**Innovation**: Metacognitive evaluation layer that self-corrects for authenticity and quality

### [WhiteSpaceIQ](https://github.com/HonestImpact/whitespaceiq-mvp) — Competitive Intelligence as an Autonomous System
**Status**: Production | Paying Client | 40+ Page Strategic Audits

Transform one month of professional deep competitive analysis into one hour of agentic insight generation.

**Why it matters**:
- Multi-agent system that *decides* what to generate, not template-fills
- RAG-powered with pgvector semantic search
- Locked foundation pattern prevents content drift across 22 LLM prompts
- Self-evaluating quality thresholds with autonomous iteration

**The technical innovation**: Built a "foundation lock" pattern where Phase 1 becomes immutable after client approval, guaranteeing voice consistency across all downstream generation. No drift. Zero human intervention after approval.

**Stack**: FastAPI, LangGraph, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Next.js, Docker
**Result**: Real client feedback: "Jaw. Dropped."

**[From 15+ Year Hiatus to Production AI: What the Gap Taught Me] (coming soon)**
The unexpected advantages of returning to code after two decades. Spoiler: Modern AI development is 80% systems thinking, 20% syntax.

## Open Source Contributions

### Extractable Components from Production Systems

**[Foundation Lock Pattern] (coming soon)** — TypeScript
Prevent content drift in multi-prompt LLM workflows. Lock approved foundation, reference it immutably downstream.

**[Metacognitive Evaluation Service] (coming soon)** — TypeScript
Self-evaluation layer for LLM outputs. Scores authenticity, quality, and craft standards before shipping.

**[Trust-Building UI Patterns] (coming soon)** — React + TypeScript
UI components that show reasoning, not just results. Transparency as a design principle.

**[Dual RAG Pipeline] (coming soon)** — Python
Keyword (PostgreSQL FTS) + Semantic (pgvector) search with intelligent routing. Production-tested.

## Background

### The Unique Path

**1990s-2008**: Trained by pioneering SAC Headquarters programmers (U.S. Air Force). Industry experience in telecom, billing, and university library systems. Certified Oracle DBA. Mission-critical systems. International projects.

**2008-2024**: Executive coaching and leadership across government, nonprofit, military, private sectors. Led 30+ person teams. $2M–$7M budgets.

**2025-Present**: Returned to hands-on engineering. Built two production AI systems in 90 days. Discovered that leadership experience + systems perspective + technical execution = rare leverage.

### What I Know That Others Don't

**From Leadership**:
- Ship or die. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.
- Users care about your architecture. They care far more about their problems.
- Culture eats strategy (and prompts) for breakfast.

**From the Gap**:
- Pre-cloud systems thinking transfers perfectly to AI orchestration.
- Modern tools are incredible, but the fundamentals haven't changed.
- The hype cycle is real. Build for real users, not demos.
- AI is a polarizing topic, and people's responses can be as myopic as any LLM's focus, but the response to AI can by anything from thrilled to terrified.

**From Both**:
- Senior leaders understand strategy but struggle with execution.
- Engineers understand execution but struggle with user needs.
- Rare to have both. Even rarer to bridge them.

## Philosophy: Lead with Soul. Succeed with Strategy.

My framework: **Compassion ~ Candor ~ Clarity**

**Compassion**: Technology serves dignity. AI amplifies human wisdom, doesn't replace it.
**Candor**: No-nonsense honesty about what works. No hype. No clever complexity.
**Clarity**: Simple solutions beat clever ones. Ship excellence, not feature creep.

This isn't just philosophy—it's embedded in the code:
- Noah's trust-first architecture comes from faith-rooted values
- WhiteSpaceIQ's locked foundation prevents manipulation
- Human and machine collaborate as partners—neither reduced to task-generator nor automaton.

### Machine Soul Language

My EP releasing soon on Spotify: **Where language conducts the machine, and the machine touches your soul.**

Three songs created in collaboration with AI:
- "The Code Calls Me" (jazzy blues fusion about the sheer joy of returning to coding and design)
- "TryIt A.I. Blues" (TryIt-AI theme about the app, mistrust of AI, and starting to wonder if there could be something good in it)
- "Something They Don't See" (WhiteSpaceIQ theme song, about building your brand based on what others don't see yet)

This is where computing meets compassion. Where technical execution serves human flourishing.

## Current Focus

**Production Systems**:
- WhiteSpaceIQ: Scaling to multiple clients on Render, refining locked foundation pattern
- TryIt-AI: Deploying scale-to-zero on Koyeb, expanding metacognitive evaluation

**Open Source**:
- Extracting reusable components from production systems
- Documentation that teaches, not just describes
- Patterns that solve real problems, not showcase techniques

**Teaching**:
- Writing technical deep-dives for engineers who build, not just demo
- Coaching leaders on AI-integrated organizations
- Bridging strategy and execution for realistic AI adoption
